# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

**Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning** is a machine learning project that identifies fraudulent credit card transactions by training and evaluating classification models on historical transaction data. The project explores multiple ML algorithms and compares their performance in detecting fraud.
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It leverages historical transaction data to train and evaluate multiple classification models that can distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities. By comparing algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree, the project aims to identify the most effective model for fraud detection. The solution helps in minimizing financial losses by enabling early and accurate identification of suspicious transactions.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
